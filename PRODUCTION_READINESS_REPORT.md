# STAFF+ PRODUCTION READINESS REPORT
**Incident Response & Deployment Audit**
*Status: GREEN (Ready for Launch)*

## 1. Executive Summary
A comprehensive audit of the repository was conducted to resolve deployment failures and runtime crashes. **All critical issues have been resolved.** The application is now hardened for Node.js 24 and Vercel.

## 2. Issues Detected & Fixed

### A. Deployment Configuration (Critical)
*   **Issue:** `package.json` had loose version ranges (`^`, `~`) and mismatched `engines` (Node 20 vs required 24).
*   **Fix:**
    *   **Locked all dependencies** to exact versions (Deterministic builds).
    *   **Enforced `node: "24.x"`** in `engines` and `.nvmrc`.
    *   **Added `node-releases` and `browserslist`** to prevent clean-install failures.

### B. Runtime Crashes (High Severity)
*   **Issue:** `ReferenceError: process is not defined` in `main.jsx`.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced with `import.meta.env.DEV` (Standard for Vite).
*   **Issue:** `ReferenceError: error is not defined` in `Login.jsx` and async flows.
    *   **Fix:** Removed references to undefined error state variable; now using `react-hot-toast` exclusively.
*   **Issue:** `ReferenceError: CONTACTS is not defined` in `Messages.jsx`.
    *   **Fix:** Added missing import for `CONTACTS`.

### C. Build Configuration
*   **Issue:** `postcss.config.js` was CommonJS.
    *   **Fix:** Converted to ESM (`export default`) for strict compatibility.
*   **Issue:** `vite.config.js` target was implicit.
    *   **Fix:** Set `target: 'esnext'` and `outDir: 'dist'` explicitly.

## 3. Verified Files (Snapshot)

### `client/package.json` (Snippet)
```json
"engines": { "node": "24.x" },
"dependencies": {
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "vite": "5.2.11"
}
```

### `client/src/main.jsx`
```javascript
// SAFE: No process.env usage
if (import.meta.env.DEV) posthog.opt_out_capturing();
```

### `client/src/auth/Login.jsx`
```javascript
// SAFE: Error handling via Toast
catch (err) {
  toast.error(err.response?.data?.message || "Failed");
}
```

## 4. Final Deployment Checklist (Vercel)

1.  **Framework Preset:** `Vite`
2.  **Root Directory:** `client` (CRITICAL)
3.  **Build Command:** `vite build`
4.  **Install Command:** `npm install`
5.  **Node.js Version:** **24.x** (Must be selected in Project Settings)

## 5. Next Steps
The repository is fully synced to GitHub (Rev: `deploy: enforce node 24 and runtime crash fixes`).

**Action:** Go to Vercel Dashboard -> Deployments -> Redeploy (with "Use existing Build Cache" **unchecked** ideally, to force a clean slate, though local simulation suggests cache is fine).
